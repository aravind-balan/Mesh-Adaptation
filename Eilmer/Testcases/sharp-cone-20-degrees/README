sg = Structured grid implementation.

usg = Unstructured grid implementation.

parametric = Parametric structured grid setup (?).

sg-import-grids = Structured grid, reading in external grids written in Eilmer format.

sg-mpi = Structured grid with MPI (parallel) processing.

sg-sss = Structured grid steady state using the Newton-Krylov accelerator.

sg-staged-prep = Structured grid with staged preparation.

new-flow-format = Structured grid with Eilmer's new flow format (new as of 2021).

udf = Structured grid with simple user-defined boundary conditions.

usg-metis = Unstructured grid with METIS block partitioning.

usg-refined = Unstructured grid using SU2 grid, single block.

usg-su2 = Unstructured grid with SU2 grid, multi-block.

sg-extra = Structured grid setup with collection of extras.
    NOTE: these all use information from an older solution, so execute ./run-base.sh first.
    - Inflow from profile (cone20B)
    - Restarting from an old solution (cone20-fine-restart)
    - Writing solutions as raw binary (cone20_rawbinary)
